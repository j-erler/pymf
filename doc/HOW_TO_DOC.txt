The documentation uses Sphinx, some rst files and the doc included in the source code.

To create documentation :

- compile healpy and install Sphinx so that it is accessible from python
- go to the doc/ directory
- [OPTIONAL]
- $ make html
- $ make latex

This will create the documentation in doc/_build/html and  doc/_build/latex.
A .pdf file can be generated my running the MAKEFILE in the latex directory:

- $ make

If changes are applied to any file, the previous build should be cleaned before
a new one is created:

- $ make clean


The documentation of the master branch is also available at readthedoc :

    https://pymf.readthedocs.io/

It is rebuild from the master branch at each commit (so it is always the latest version).
